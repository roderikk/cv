% As a researcher I have become adept at looking at a problem from multiple angles.
% The fields of study I have chosen have allowed me to cooperate with people from many disciplines, (aero)space engineers, geologists, data analists and remote sensing experts.
% This has taught me to always look for cross-domain applications.
% The international work environments and collaborations I have pursued have made me into a team player.

I'm looking for a work environment that provides many challenges in the form of dedicated problems.
An environment where I can apply myself individually, and as an integral part of a team.
And an environment that gives me the space to develop my own ideas and search for synergies with other aspects of the business.
